## Code Ninja 10x Developers:
- Don't document their code.
- Don't test, except in production.
- Don't share their knowledge.
- Have no life! They code even in weekends and holidays.
- Don't care about how clean their git history is.
- Add "lines of code" or long stories in MD files to improve metrics.
- Just commit, commit, commit, and pushhhhhh.
- But they earn $500K/year! - smart, right?

More commits = more money because we count productivity by the number of commits and lines of code! 😀

How to become a 10x developer?
