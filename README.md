## Code Ninja 10x Developers:
- Don't document their code. (job security at max!)
- Don't test, except in production.
- Don't share their knowledge.
- Have no life! They code even in weekends and holidays.
- Don't care about how clean their git history is.
- Add "lines of code" or long stories in MD files to improve metrics.
- Always say "yes boss!" to Scrum Masters and Managers.
- Have superpowers: Memorize all the syntaxes and type fast!
- Just commit, commit, commit, and pushhhhhh.
- But they earn $500K/year! - smart, right?

More commits = more money because we count productivity by the number of commits and lines of code! 😀

How to become a 10x developer?  
That's a secret! And 10x developers never share their secrets! ;)

## A side 10x note

Someone said **"but 10x0 = 0!"**  
Remember, 0x10 = 16 = 2xPizzaTeamDeveloper! 🍕🍕  
If you feel like a 0x developer, no worries! All you need to do is to change the order!
